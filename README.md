# AmazingMouseRunner

Disclaimer: This is not very recent project and I learned a lot since making it. I decided to leave it here because it shows my experience with UE5 and ability to create fun gameplay. For quality, clean code go [here](https://github.com/antoniwidelski/TerrainGeneration).

This project is fully finished but not released yet game in the genre of endless runner.

It's made in Unreal Engine 5 with C++ and blueprints.

As it's finished game I went through all the stages of game development from idea to polishing.

I did all the design, coding, all UI images and most of the 3d models. Mouse's and Enemy's models, their animations, sky and all sounds are NOT created by me.

Video of gameplay is available on YouTube:
